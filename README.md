# Smart Pharmacy

In a traditional pharmacy, you speak to a human, and they sort through shelves of various drugs to fetch what matches your prescription. It is a process that could benefit from automation. A smart pharmacy can be easier to use, more private, more anonymous, more secure, faster, and lower cost than a human-run pharmacy. This repository contains the code needed for our proof of concept. A database on a server stores patient data, including prescriptions. The doctor's client runs on a regular desktop environment and is used by the doctor to add and modify patient records, effectively assigning prescriptions. The pharmacy client runs on a Raspberry Pi and interacts with the user, getting their face fingerprint using face recognition technology, authenticating them with the server, and controlling the hardware that dispenses the drugs. Finally, some motors turn some coils to actually dispense the drug product, like a vending machine. With all the code and other resources here, and a bit of work, our setup could be reproduced.

NOTE: Due to a bug in IntelliJ IDEA, if run from inside IntelliJ, the doctor client application will not ask for permission to use the webcam when capturing face recognition data and will instead crash. To work around this, run it from the terminal with `gradle run` if running from source.
